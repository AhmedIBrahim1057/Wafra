He received the "Doctorat de Specialit√©" and the "Doctorat d'Etat" in electronics from Grenoble University and Institute Polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG), France in 1976 and 1980 respectively. From 1972 to 1979 he was a research assistant at LETI and then at THOMSON-EFCIS from 1979 to 1980, both in Grenoble, France. He then joined the Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University as assistant professor. Since 1990 he is a professor of electronics in the same department where he is also the director of the "Integrated Circuits Lab" from 1980 to 2006. Since 2006 he became professor emeritus at Ain Shams University and is also seconded to the French University of Egypt as head of the Information and Communications Technology department. Then he is back to Ain Shams University till now.

                                    Benjamin Korth devotes himself to investigations of thermodynamics of electroactive microorganisms. By doing so, he developed new tools (e.g., bioelectrocalorimetry, mathematical modeling platform) for analyzing the energetic fundamentals of electroactive microorganisms and bioelectrochemical systems as well as developed methods for the energetic analysis and treatment of wastewater. He published 12 peer-reviewed papers and 1 book chapter and received the Helmholtz-PhD award in the research area "Energy" as well as several awards for oral presentations in international conferences and in public science events.
